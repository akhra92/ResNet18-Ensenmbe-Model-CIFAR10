Image classification using ResNet18 model on Cifar10 dataset. Python 3.9, pytorch 1.10.1+cuda11.3, torchvision 0.11.2+cuda11.3, and timm 0.9.2 were used to formulate the training and testing. The testing accuracy of 97.26% was achieved.

- for training use the following command:
```
python train.py
```

- for testing use the following command:
```
python test.py
```
